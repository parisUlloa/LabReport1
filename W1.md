**If a question pops up in te terminal it is valid to say YES to anything the software is asking in order to have a smooth installation**


* In order to set up ur ieng6 account we will begin by typing `ssh` first then following your _AD username_ 

For example:
>My AD username is 'paguilarulloa' so it would look something like this 
>* In order to go directly to the account youll have to type '@ieng6.ucsd.edu' right after your typed the username.

* Next youll click enter, which will result with the terminal asking for a _PassWord_\
Once you type your AD password it will not show anything in the terminal this is for secuirty purposes (so no one can see you type the password!!)
